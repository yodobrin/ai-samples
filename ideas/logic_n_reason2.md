# Migration Plan from Python to .NET

## Epics, Features, and User Stories

### Epic 1: Migrate Core Analysis Functionality
- **Feature**: Convert Analysis Notebook to C# .NET Environment
  - **User Story**: As a developer, I want the existing Python-based analysis notebook logic re-implemented in .NET so that I can maintain the same analytical capabilities using the .NET toolchain.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      1. A .NET project is created and compiles successfully.
      2. Equivalent data analysis outputs are produced when compared to the existing Python notebook results.
      3. Data visualization (if any) is accounted for using .NET-compatible libraries.

### Epic 2: Refactor Reasoning Engine
- **Feature**: Implement Reasoning Module in .NET
  - **User Story**: As a developer, I want a .NET class (or set of classes) that emulates the Python reasoning engine to preserve the same business logic for decision making.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      1. The .NET reasoning module returns identical decisions or classifications as the Python version.
      2. Integration tests confirm that the logic flow (e.g., branching, conditions, and outcomes) behaves as expected.

### Epic 3: Validate Data Handling & Persistence
- **Feature**: Data Ingestion & Storage
  - **User Story**: As a systems engineer, I want consistent data retrieval and storage in .NET to ensure data integrity across the migration.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      1. The data ingestion in .NET is performed securely and efficiently.
      2. Data transformations match the original notebook’s transformations.
      3. Database or local file operations adhere to new environment requirements (e.g., Entity Framework or direct file IO).

### Epic 4: Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Feature**: Automated Testing Framework
  - **User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want automated unit tests verifying the .NET solution mirrors the Python solution’s core functionality to ensure correctness.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      1. Tests exist to compare .NET outputs with baseline outputs from the Python version.
      2. Logging or reporting confirms 100% alignment, or details any discrepancies for further review.

## Reasoning and Logic Explanation

Below is a pseudocode outline summarizing the main classes and how the reasoning workflow functions.

```csharp name=MainClassesPseudocode.cs
// High-level pseudocode of the .NET classes

class DataAnalysis
{
    private DataLoader loader;
    private DataTransformer transformer;
    private ReasoningEngine reasoning;
    
    public DataAnalysis()
    {
        loader = new DataLoader();
        transformer = new DataTransformer();
        reasoning = new ReasoningEngine();
    }

    public void RunAnalysis()
    {
        var rawData = loader.LoadData(); // step 1: fetch raw data
        var transformedData = transformer.Transform(rawData); // step 2: clean/normalize
        var results = reasoning.Analyze(transformedData); // step 3: apply reasoning logic
        // step 4: present or store results
        Console.WriteLine(results.Summary);
    }
}

class DataLoader
{
    // Simulates reading from a file, DB, or external APIs
    public SomeDataStructure LoadData()
    {
        // Pseudocode: read source, parse data into objects
        return new SomeDataStructure(...);
    }
}

class DataTransformer
{
    // Cleans or formats data
    public SomeDataStructure Transform(SomeDataStructure inputData)
    {
        // Pseudocode: remove duplicates, handle missing values, convert data forms
        return processedData;
    }
}

class ReasoningEngine
{
    private Ruleset rules;
    private InferenceMechanism inference;

    public ReasoningEngine()
    {
        rules = new Ruleset();
        inference = new InferenceMechanism(rules);
    }

    public AnalysisResult Analyze(SomeDataStructure data)
    {
        // Summarize or deduce outcomes based on rules and logic
        var partialFindings = inference.ApplyForwardChaining(data);
        var finalConclusion = inference.ApplyBackwardChaining(partialFindings);
        
        return new AnalysisResult(finalConclusion);
    }
}

class Ruleset
{
    // Stores domain-specific conditions
    public List<Rule> DomainRules { get; set; }

    public Ruleset()
    {
        // Construct the set of rules in pseudocode:
        DomainRules = new List<Rule>
        {
            new Rule("If X is true, infer Y"),
            new Rule("If A & B, conclude C"),
            // ...
        };
    }
}

class InferenceMechanism
{
    private Ruleset ruleset;

    public InferenceMechanism(Ruleset rs)
    {
        ruleset = rs;
    }

    public IntermediateResults ApplyForwardChaining(SomeDataStructure data)
    {
        // Evaluate each rule with current data
        // Accumulate new facts or inferences
        return new IntermediateResults(...);
    }

    public object ApplyBackwardChaining(IntermediateResults partialFindings)
    {
        // Start from a goal or question, then check which rules/facts lead to it
        // Accumulate final conclusion
        return finalInference;
    }
}

// Represents final results of reasoning
class AnalysisResult
{
    public string Summary { get; private set; }

    public AnalysisResult(object reasoningOutcome)
    {
        // Format or store final conclusion
        Summary = reasoningOutcome.ToString();
    }
}

// Utility classes
class Rule
{
    public string Definition { get; private set; }

    public Rule(string definition)
    {
        Definition = definition;
    }
}

class SomeDataStructure
{
    // Pseudocode for data representation
    // Could include arrays, lists, or domain-specific objects
}

class IntermediateResults
{
    // Carries partially inferred data or states
    // ...
}
```

### How Reasoning Works
1. Data is ingested and preprocessed to ensure feature completeness and data consistency.  
2. A set of domain rules is maintained in a central structure (Ruleset).  
3. The InferenceMechanism uses forward-chaining (evaluate known data to discover new conclusions) and backward-chaining (starting from a target conclusion to see if the data and rules support it).  
4. In doing so, the ReasoningEngine deduces or classifies outcomes by combining partial results.
