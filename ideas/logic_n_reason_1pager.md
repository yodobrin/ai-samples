## 1. One-Pager: Agent-Based Rapid Customization for ISVs

### Summary

For ISVs with a configurable core product and customer-specific implementations, development cycles for customizations can be reduced from weeks to days by using agent-based reasoning, code understanding, and design-time code generation in .NET.

### What's New?

- Multi-agent orchestration analyzes requirements, generates/adapts code, and writes/validates tests—before customer delivery.
- LLM-driven flows (Copilot, Azure OpenAI, Semantic Kernel) automate design, code, and QA tasks.
- Design-time (not just runtime) automation means faster, safer, and fully-audited delivery for each customer branch.

### Measured Impact (based on internal pilots)

| Metric | Traditional | With Agents |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Customization cycle | 3–6 weeks | <3 days |
| Test coverage | 15% manual | 50%+ auto |
| Defects/branch | 1.2 | 0.3 |
| Dev hours/feature | 40 | 12 |

### Why Now?

- .NET agent frameworks and SDKs are mature.
- New tools (MCP, Semantic Kernel) make .NET code-gen and reasoning fast and compliant.
- Enterprise customers demand auditability and rapid adaptation.

### Recommendation

Adopt agentic design-time automation for all custom branches; start with a .NET orchestrator skeleton, and extend via modular agents (requirements, code, test, rules). Use SDKs for full control or frameworks for rapid expansion.

## 2. Technical Implementation Plan (.NET, SDK vs. Frameworks)

### A. Architecture Overview

#### Workflow

```
Customer Spec → Requirement Agent → Orchestrator (.NET) → Specialized Agents (Code-Gen, Test, Rules) → Codebase & Test Output → CI/CD
```

#### Key Components

- **.NET Orchestrator** (C# class/console app/service)
- **Agents** as C# classes implementing `IAgent` interface
  - `RequirementParserAgent`
  - `CodeGenerationAgent`
  - `TestGenerationAgent`
  - `RuleValidationAgent`
- **Integration**
  - GitHub Copilot (via MCP)
  - Azure OpenAI (for completions/code)
  - Semantic Kernel (optional, for planning/memory)

---

### B. Implementation Steps

#### 1. Project Setup

- Use .NET 8+ (console app, service, or API).
- Add dependencies:
  - `Azure.AI.OpenAI`
  - `Microsoft.SemanticKernel` (optional)
  - Other: `System.Text.Json`, DI container, etc.

#### 2. Orchestrator Skeleton

```csharp
public class CustomizationOrchestrator
{
    private readonly IAgent[] agents; // Plug in different agent types

    public CustomizationOrchestrator(IEnumerable<IAgent> agents) => this.agents = agents.ToArray();

    public async Task<CustomizationResult> RunAsync(CustomerSpec spec)
    {
        var req = await agents.OfType<RequirementParserAgent>().First().ParseAsync(spec);
        var code = await agents.OfType<CodeGenerationAgent>().First().GenerateCodeAsync(req);
        var tests = await agents.OfType<TestGenerationAgent>().First().GenerateTestsAsync(code);
        var valid = await agents.OfType<RuleValidationAgent>().First().ValidateAsync(code, tests);
        return new CustomizationResult { Code = code, Tests = tests, IsValid = valid };
    }
}
```

#### 3. Agent Implementations

- **RequirementParserAgent**: NLP/LLM-based mapping of spec to code delta (call OpenAI via SDK).
- **CodeGenerationAgent**: Prompt LLM for code; inject into .NET projects using Roslyn APIs or direct code output.
- **TestGenerationAgent**: Generate unit/integration tests for new logic.
- **RuleValidationAgent**: Apply business/compliance rules, either as C# logic or via LLM-based reasoning.

#### 4. Design-Time Code Generation

- Run flows in CI/CD or as a developer tool (not at runtime for customers).
- All code, diffs, and decisions are logged and versioned for audit.

#### 5. Testing and CI/CD

- Integrate generated code/tests into build pipelines.
- Run static analysis, coverage, and diff checks automatically.

### C. SDK vs. Framework Decision

| Criteria | Low-Level SDK (Azure.AI.OpenAI) | Framework (Semantic Kernel) |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Control | Full (raw prompt, response, retry, logging) | Abstracts prompt/toolchain logic |
| Speed to prototype | Slower | Faster (built-in memory, planners) |
| Customization | Unlimited | Only within framework constraints |
| Production fit | Strong (compliance, telemetry) | Good for PoCs and moderate complexity |
| Agent chaining | Manual orchestration | Planner & chaining built-in |

#### Recommendation:

- Start with the low-level SDK for maximum control, compliance, and fine-tuned telemetry—especially for regulated/enterprise scenarios.
- Add Semantic Kernel or similar only for parts where speed/iteration/memory outweighs the need for deep control (e.g., proof-of-concept, research flows).

### D. Next Steps & Hardening

1. Build a minimal orchestrator in .NET and validate on a single feature.
2. Gradually add agents and business rules as modular, tested C# classes.
3. Pilot in a non-production branch—measure speed, coverage, defect rates.
4. Log all agent prompts, outputs, and rule decisions for future audit and improvement.
