# Migration Strategy: Python to .NET for the AdaptIQ Agent

This document outlines a high-level approach to migrate the AdaptIQ Agent codebase from Python to .NET. It focuses on concepts, planning artifacts (epics, user stories, features), and guidanceâ€”rather than providing full .NET code. It also evaluates SDK options (low-level vs. frameworks like Semantic Kernel).

---

## 1. Goals and Scope

- Maintain existing functionality: multi-agent orchestration, research iterations, and report synthesis.
- Leverage .NET ecosystem for performance, type safety, and enterprise support.
- Evaluate trade-offs between using Azure OpenAI low-level SDK and higher-level frameworks.

## 2. Migration Epics and User Stories

### Epic 1: Core Orchestration Infrastructure
- **User Story 1.1**: As a developer, I want to port the `ResearchOrchestrator` logic into .NET so that I can orchestrate agent workflows using C#.
- **User Story 1.2**: As a tech lead, I need the async processing pipeline and tool-call machinery re-implemented in .NET Task-based model.

### Epic 2: Agent Abstractions and Tools
- **User Story 2.1**: As a developer, I want to define a base `Agent` interface in .NET with pluggable tool methods.
- **User Story 2.2**: As an AI engineer, I want each specialized agent (SupportCaseSearch, APRLRecommendation, MSLearnRecommendation, WebScraper) implemented as a .NET class, exposing SDK or HTTP clients.

### Epic 3: Integration with Azure OpenAI
- **User Story 3.1**: As a developer, I want to call Azure OpenAI completions through the official .NET SDK so that I can replace Python client usage.
- **User Story 3.2**: As a researcher, I want the ability to swap between low-level `OpenAIClient` and higher-level frameworks (Semantic Kernel) with minimal code changes.

### Epic 4: Notebook and CLI Workflows
- **User Story 4.1**: As a user, I want interactive notebooks replaced or complemented by .NET interactive notebooks (C# in Jupyter/VS Code) or CLI tools.

### Features Breakdown
- **Feature 1**: BaseAgent abstraction in C# with tool registration and invocation.
- **Feature 2**: Research iteration loop utilizing `async/await` and cancellation tokens.
- **Feature 3**: Report planning and writing components, generating Markdown output.
- **Feature 4**: Clients for external services (ZebraAI, APRL JSON, MS Learn) using HttpClient and typed models.
- **Feature 5**: Configuration management via `IConfiguration` and `Options` pattern.

## 3. Key .NET Concepts and Patterns

| Python Pattern               | .NET Equivalent                            |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `async def` + `await`        | `async Task` + `await`                     |
| Pydantic models              | C# record or `class` with System.Text.Json |
| `@tool` decorator           | Attribute-based metadata + Reflection      |
| OpenAI Python client         | Azure.AI.OpenAI (`OpenAIClient`)           |
| Notebook entrypoint (IPython)| .NET Interactive, LINQPad, or CLI app      |

### 3.1 Agent and Tool Registration
- Create an `IAgent` interface with a `ProcessQueryAsync` method.
- Use custom attributes (`[Tool(FunctionName)]`) to mark tool methods.
- Reflect over agent classes at startup to build a tool registry.

### 3.2 Orchestration Loop
- Implement a `ResearchOrchestrator` class that:
  - Tracks iterations using a `Stopwatch` and `int` counters.
  - Calls `GenerateThoughtsAsync`, `EvaluateGapsAsync`, `SelectAgentsAsync`, `RunAgentTasksAsync`.
  - Uses `Parallel.ForEachAsync` or `Task.WhenAll` for concurrent agent tasks.

### 3.3 Data Models and Serialization
- Define C# models for:
  - `ReportPlan`, `ReportDraft`, `ResearchIteration`, etc.
- Use `System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json` for JSON handling.

### 3.4 Dependency Injection
- Leverage `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` to register agents, HTTP clients, and `OpenAIClient`.
- Scoping: `Singleton` for clients, `Transient` for per-operation services.

## 4. Azure OpenAI SDK vs. Semantic Kernel

### 4.1 Low-Level SDK (`Azure.AI.OpenAI`)
- **Pros**: 
  - Fine-grained control over request/response.
  - Fewer hidden abstractions; easy to map Python code one-to-one.
- **Cons**: 
  - You must implement pipeline logic (tool calls, retries).
  - Less built-in templating or memory management.

### 4.2 Semantic Kernel
- **Pros**:
  - Built-in skill and prompt management.
  - Supports planner, memory, chaining out-of-the-box.
- **Cons**:
  - Opinionated binding and life cycle.
  - Rapidly evolving API; potential breaking changes.

#### Recommendation
- Start with the low-level SDK for core orchestration and tool invocation. 
- Evaluate adding Semantic Kernel for higher-level scenarios (e.g., memory or chaining), wrapping it behind an abstraction interface so it can be swapped out.

## 5. Example: Translating a Python Async Call

**Python**:
```python
thoughts = await orchestrator._async_generate_thoughts(
    iteration_idx=1,
    query="Topic",
    previous_observations=None,
    background_context="Context"
)
```

**C# (.NET)**:
```csharp
var thoughts = await orchestrator.GenerateThoughtsAsync(
    iterationIndex: 1,
    query: "Topic",
    previousObservations: null,
    backgroundContext: "Context",
    cancellationToken: ct
);
```
- Use `Task<string>` instead of `Coroutine`.
- Pass `CancellationToken` for time-limit enforcement.

## 6. Migration Approach and Phases

1. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**
   - Port `BaseAgent` and one agent (e.g. SupportCaseSearchAgent) to .NET.
   - Wire up Azure OpenAI low-level calls.
2. **Core Orchestrator**
   - Implement `ResearchOrchestrator` and iteration loop.
3. **Complete Agent Suite**
   - Port APRL, MSLearn, WebScraper agents.
4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Unit tests with xUnit and mocks for HTTP and OpenAI clients.
5. **Documentation and Samples**
   - Provide C# interactive notebook examples.
6. **Framework Evaluation**
   - Integrate Semantic Kernel behind abstraction and compare capabilities.

## 7. Conclusion

Migrating to .NET involves translating async patterns, data models, and orchestration logic into C# idioms. By organizing the work into epics, user stories, and features, you can plan incremental development. Start with the low-level Azure OpenAI SDK for stability, then optionally adopt Semantic Kernel for advanced orchestration. The proposed approach provides structure while maintaining flexibility to swap frameworks as they evolve.
