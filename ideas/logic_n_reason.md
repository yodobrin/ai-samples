# Epics, Features, and User Stories

## Epic 1: Data Analysis and Reporting
- **Feature**: Data Loading and Parsing
  - **User Story**: As a data analyst, I want to load raw data files and parse them into a standardized structure so that I can easily manipulate and explore the data set.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. A well-defined parser is provided to handle various data formats.
      2. Loaded data is accessible through a consistent interface.
      3. Parsing errors are reported with clear error messages.

- **Feature**: Data Transformation
  - **User Story**: As a data scientist, I want to clean and preprocess the data so that I can ensure data consistency and readiness for analysis.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Data transformation logic handles missing or invalid values.
      2. Duplicate records are removed or merged appropriately.
      3. Processed data maintains domain-specific integrity checks.

- **Feature**: Visualization & Reporting
  - **User Story**: As a product manager, I want a visual representation of the analysis so that I can quickly interpret trends and insights.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Graphs and charts reflect correct data and relevant metrics.
      2. Visual elements are rendered in a standardized, user-friendly framework.
      3. Reports can be exported or shared in common formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).

## Epic 2: Reasoning and Decision Engine
- **Feature**: Rule Definition
  - **User Story**: As a system architect, I want to define domain rules in a centralized location so that any changes in logic can be updated consistently.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Rule sets are stored in an accessible, well-documented structure.
      2. Each rule includes a clear definition and conditions for evaluation.
      3. Rule sets are reloadable at runtime without requiring a full system restart (if feasible).

- **Feature**: Inference Mechanism
  - **User Story**: As a developer, I want the system to automate forward-chaining and backward-chaining so that conclusions and decisions are derived based on the provided data sets.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. The inference engine applies domain rules iteratively for forward-chaining.
      2. Backward-chaining can confirm a goal or conclusion by navigating necessary rules.
      3. The engine logs intermediate inferences for debugging or auditing.

- **Feature**: Actionable Outcomes
  - **User Story**: As a business stakeholder, I want the solution’s reasoning engine to produce recommendations or alerts so that I can act on the insights immediately.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Final decisions or classifications are clearly outlined.
      2. Alerts or notifications are triggered when critical thresholds are met.
      3. Integration points exist for external systems (e.g., webhooks, APIs) to receive or process the solution’s output.

## Epic 3: System Maintainability and Scalability
- **Feature**: Modular Architecture
  - **User Story**: As a lead engineer, I want modular code components so that each part of the system can be maintained or extended independently.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Data loading, transformation, and reasoning functionalities operate as separate modules.
      2. Each module has clear interfaces for communication.
      3. Unit and integration tests exist for each module to verify reliability.

- **Feature**: Performance and Scalability
  - **User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want the ability to handle large data volumes and parallel processing so that analysis remains efficient at scale.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Analysis jobs complete within acceptable time frames.
      2. The system supports parallel or distributed processing where applicable.
      3. Resource usage metrics (e.g., memory, CPU) are monitored and logged.

- **Feature**: Continuous Integration and Deployment
  - **User Story**: As a release manager, I want to automate builds and deployments so that any code or rule changes are quickly integrated into the production environment.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. A CI pipeline ensures all tests pass before merging.
      2. Deployments to testing, staging, or production environments are streamlined.
      3. Each deployment is logged and version-controlled for rollback if needed.
