# MCP Code Generation with GitHub Copilot

## üß† Conceptual Foundation

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables applications to expose tools, resources, and prompts to large language models (LLMs). It allows agents to interact with external systems in a structured, secure, and extensible way [1](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/presentations/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B89AB55CF-6E34-42F7-A82B-6B1A9AF8EB7A%7D&file=BRK158%2005222025%20Build.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [2](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GCR_MBS_Team_Sharepoint/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B16DB4C81-B9FA-4595-87BE-942019B6ABD0%7D&file=BRK158%20-%20Building%20agents%20in%20Copilot%20Studio%20using%20Model%20Context%20Protocol.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

### GitHub Copilot + MCP

GitHub Copilot can be extended using MCP servers to provide context-aware code suggestions. These servers can be configured locally or remotely and integrated into IDEs like VS Code and Visual Studio [3](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/using-model-context-protocol/using-the-github-mcp-server) [4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers?view=vs-2022) [5](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

## üõ†Ô∏è Design-Time Code Generation with Dedicated Agents

### Agentic Architecture

Agents built using Copilot Studio and MCP can be designed to:
- Expose tools (e.g., APIs, scripts)
- Retrieve structured data (e.g., locale settings, customer profiles)
- Generate or modify code based on predefined prompts and templates [2](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GCR_MBS_Team_Sharepoint/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B16DB4C81-B9FA-4595-87BE-942019B6ABD0%7D&file=BRK158%20-%20Building%20agents%20in%20Copilot%20Studio%20using%20Model%20Context%20Protocol.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [6](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AGPSCopilotStudioAgents/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5BC71B99-1C96-42FC-AD85-66294011F48B%7D&file=Copilot%20Studio%20Agents%20and%20M365%20Extensibility.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

This architecture supports:
- **Single-agent** or **multi-agent** systems
- **Human-in-the-loop** or **fully autonomous** workflows
- **Custom authentication** and **role-based access** [6](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AGPSCopilotStudioAgents/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5BC71B99-1C96-42FC-AD85-66294011F48B%7D&file=Copilot%20Studio%20Agents%20and%20M365%20Extensibility.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

### Use Case: ISV Codebase Customization

An ISV building a generic codebase for multiple customers can use MCP agents to:
- Detect customer-specific requirements (e.g., locale, currency, date format)
- Generate tailored code snippets at design time
- Inject these into the base code using GitHub Copilot‚Äôs context-aware suggestions

This is especially useful for:
- Localization/internationalization
- Feature toggling
- Compliance and regulatory adaptations

---

## üß© Polynomial-Time Reduction Analogy

In computational theory, a polynomial-time reduction transforms one problem into another in polynomial time. Analogously, an MCP agent could:
1. **Map** customer-specific requirements to a canonical form (e.g., a JSON schema)
2. **Reduce** this schema to a set of code generation tasks
3. **Solve** each task using Copilot + MCP tools in a bounded time frame

This approach ensures:
- Predictable performance
- Modular code generation
- Reusability across customer contexts

---

## üß™ Practical Implementation

### Toolchain

- **VS Code Insiders** with GitHub Copilot pre-release
- **.vscode/mcp.json** for project-level configuration
- **MCP servers** like `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` or `mcp-server-fetch` [7](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/GitHubHelp/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD074F342-FDAF-401D-A8CC-EEC9627A4FEA%7D&file=VS%20Code%20support%20for%20MCP%20server%20tools%20in%20agent%20mode%20overview.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
- **Azure AI Foundry** and **AI Toolkit** for model selection and deployment [8](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADBmYzIyZmJmLTE4ZmItNGU2Ni05Y2NiLTE2YzA5OGQzN2Q4NQBGAAAAAACpkaHzv4I%2fSJemwM5DjQQ2BwCch%2b7AK3NSS6g8Dme7EgtzAAAAAAEMAACch%2b7AK3NSS6g8Dme7EgtzAAa%2fgzibAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

### Example: Sales Prep Coach Agent

A real-world example from Microsoft shows how agents can be built using:
- GitHub Copilot for code generation
- Azure AI Foundry for model orchestration
- Data Wrangler for preprocessing
- MCP for tool orchestration [8](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADBmYzIyZmJmLTE4ZmItNGU2Ni05Y2NiLTE2YzA5OGQzN2Q4NQBGAAAAAACpkaHzv4I%2fSJemwM5DjQQ2BwCch%2b7AK3NSS6g8Dme7EgtzAAAAAAEMAACch%2b7AK3NSS6g8Dme7EgtzAAa%2fgzibAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

## üß≠ Strategic Considerations for ISVs

| Challenge | Agentic Solution |
|----------|------------------|
| Multi-locale support | Use MCP to fetch locale-specific settings and inject into templates |
| Feature modularity | Define agent tools for each feature; activate based on customer profile |
| Code governance | Use Copilot‚Äôs code referencing and filtering features to ensure compliance [9](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GithubSales/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA5268C4D-836D-40BE-BAE4-38CDC16A9B0B%7D&file=GitHub%20Copilot%20FAQ%20Mar%2024%20Update.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [10](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GithubSales/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B73C9B721-620E-435F-92D4-E8A7D4E6F0C0%7D&file=GitHub%20Copilot%20FAQ%20Final%20V2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) |
| Performance | Use MCP‚Äôs structured prompts and tool chaining to reduce latency and complexity [2](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GCR_MBS_Team_Sharepoint/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B16DB4C81-B9FA-4595-87BE-942019B6ABD0%7D&file=BRK158%20-%20Building%20agents%20in%20Copilot%20Studio%20using%20Model%20Context%20Protocol.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) |

# Custom AI Solution vs. Azure AI Foundry: Cost, Scalability & Best Practices

**Overview:** This report compares two approaches for implementing large-scale AI workflows that require both deterministic processing (e.g. database queries) and dynamic AI tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis or document understanding). We examine building a **custom solution** using frameworks like **Semantic Kernel** or **Dapr AI Agents** (likely deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service), versus using the **Azure AI Foundry** managed platform. Key considerations include development and maintenance costs, scalability to millions of tasks per day, ease of customization for different customers, adherence to the **Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)** five pillars (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization), and the trade-offs between design-time coded workflows vs. run-time LLM-driven logic.

## Initial Development Cost and Effort

**Azure AI Foundry (Agent Service)** ‚Äì *Low Development Overhead.* Foundry is a **platform-as-a-service (PaaS)** that provides a **user-friendly interface and comprehensive toolset** for building multi-agent applications[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/). Many components are pre-built: a large catalog of models (including GPT-4, Llama, etc.), connectors for knowledge sources (e.g. Bing search, SharePoint, databases), and action integrations (e.g. Azure Functions, Logic Apps)[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). You can assemble solutions through configuration or minimal code using the Foundry SDK. This greatly **reduces initial coding effort** ‚Äì for example, adding an API integration is as simple as providing an OpenAPI spec or using drag-and-drop Logic Apps, rather than writing the integration from scratch[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). The platform‚Äôs ‚Äúagent factory‚Äù approach handles much of the orchestration and sequencing logic internally[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview). In short, Foundry accelerates development: it **streamlines building AI workflows** by handling many details behind the scenes (tools, identity, concurrency, etc.) so your team writes less boilerplate code.

> **Example:** At Build 2025, Microsoft demonstrated creating a support ticket agent in Foundry with just a few lines of configuration code ‚Äì connecting an email trigger, an LLM for reasoning, and a DevOps API for action„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. They compared this to a fully custom code approach which would require manually writing the email listener, parsing, calling an LLM API, handling the API call for ticket creation, error retries, etc.

**Semantic Kernel (Custom Code)** ‚Äì *High Development Effort.* Semantic Kernel (SK) is an **open-source development kit** that lets developers incorporate LLM AI into applications via a programming model of ‚Äúskills‚Äù and ‚Äúplans‚Äù. It is essentially a **framework** or *middleware* that you embed in your own codebase[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/). This means initial development involves writing significant custom code: you have to design the workflow, implement calls to models, and possibly integrate with external services manually. While SK provides useful abstractions (like planners and memory), you are responsible for building the overall solution structure. 

- **For deterministic tasks**, you‚Äôll write traditional code (e.g. C# methods to query a database).
- **For AI tasks**, you use SK to call LLM completions or embeddings, but you must define the prompts and handle responses. 
- **Orchestration** (chaining steps) can be done in code or using SK‚Äôs **Process Framework** for workflows, which still needs developer-defined steps and triggers.

Overall, building the solution with SK is like any custom software project: **more initial design and coding time** compared to a ready platform. However, SK‚Äôs advantage is that it **supports .NET natively** (as well as Python/Java)[4](https://techoral.com/ai/ai-agent-frameworks.html)[4](https://techoral.com/ai/ai-agent-frameworks.html), aligning well with a .NET team‚Äôs skills. This can mitigate some effort since your team can leverage familiar tools and languages. Still, expect a **higher up-front investment** to achieve what Foundry offers out-of-the-box.

**Dapr AI Agents (Custom Microservices)** ‚Äì *High Development & Setup Effort.* The Dapr Agents framework (introduced Mar 2025) builds on the Dapr microservices runtime. It provides an **enterprise-ready scaffolding for AI agent systems on Kubernetes**[4](https://techoral.com/ai/ai-agent-frameworks.html)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). Using Dapr Agents likely entails:

- Setting up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g. Azure Kubernetes Service).
- Deploying Dapr sidecars and the Dapr Agents runtime.
- Writing **agent logic as code** (in Python, .NET or other languages Dapr supports) and defining workflows using Dapr‚Äôs APIs (e.g. its workflow engine or message bus).
- Managing configurations for state stores, pub/sub topics, etc.

Initial development requires **expertise in cloud-native architecture**. While Dapr Agents simplifies some aspects (it has built-in workflow coordination and tool plugins for common tasks[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/)), it‚Äôs still a **DIY approach**. Your team will implement each microservice (or agent) behavior and orchestrate their interactions. In addition, the environment must be configured for networking, security, and scaling. This translates to a **substantial initial setup and coding effort** ‚Äì larger than Foundry‚Äôs and comparable or higher than SK‚Äôs, given the added complexity of distributed systems.

**Summary:** **Foundry has the lowest initial development cost** because many capabilities are pre-built and require configuration instead of coding[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/). **SK demands significant coding** but stays within a single app context, whereas **Dapr Agents demands coding plus infrastructure** (K8s) expertise. If time-to-market and development hours are critical, Foundry provides a jump-start at the expense of some flexibility. SK and Dapr give ultimate flexibility but at a higher upfront engineering cost.

## Ongoing Maintenance and Operations

**Azure AI Foundry** ‚Äì *Lower Maintenance Overhead.* Since Foundry is a fully managed service, many operational aspects are handled by Azure:

- **Platform Maintenance:** Azure takes care of updating the underlying infrastructure, scaling the service, and patching tools/models. There are no servers or containers for your team to manage directly.
- **Built-in Monitoring:** Foundry provides integrated **observability** (traces, logs, metrics) and evaluation tools. Agent runs and performance can be tracked in the Foundry portal or forwarded to Azure Application Insights[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/)[5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE034F074-C965-4EDF-B27D-7F3DE318D726%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI%20-%20MVP%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). This reduces the effort to set up custom monitoring. For example, Foundry automatically logs each agent ‚Äúthread‚Äù (conversation) and each ‚Äúrun‚Äù (turn) with timing and outcome metrics for inspection„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë.
- **AI Service Management:** Model deployments, scaling decisions for the LLMs, etc., can be managed through Foundry‚Äôs interface. If you need to update a model or fine-tune, Foundry provides pipelines for that, alleviating custom DevOps work[6](https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/sites/smcgcrresources/Shared%20Documents/1.Solution%20Area/Azure/01.Azure%20Solution/Azure%20Data%20&%20AI/%e4%ba%a7%e5%93%81%e6%96%87%e6%a1%a3/OpenAI/FAQ/Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20FAQ.PDF?web=1).
- **Updates and New Features:** Microsoft will continuously enhance Foundry (as seen with new tools like **Bing Custom Search, SharePoint connectors, Content Understanding** introduced in Build 2025[7](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFBED6203-060C-4AA3-B97E-249953823DDE%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)[5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE034F074-C965-4EDF-B27D-7F3DE318D726%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI%20-%20MVP%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)). These become available to you without heavy lifting. 

Overall, day-to-day maintenance (ensuring uptime, applying security patches) is largely offloaded to Microsoft. Your team‚Äôs effort centers on **managing the application logic** (e.g. refining prompts or workflows) and monitoring business metrics, rather than managing infrastructure. This can significantly **reduce ongoing costs** in personnel time.

**Semantic Kernel (Custom Solution)** ‚Äì *Higher Maintenance Burden.* With a custom SK-based solution, **you own the entire application lifecycle**. This includes:

- **Infrastructure & App Maintenance:** If deployed on Azure (e.g. as a Web App or function or container), you must monitor and patch those compute resources. Ensuring the API or service hosting SK is highly available and updated is your responsibility.
- **Scaling & Performance Tuning:** As load grows, you need to scale out your solution (e.g. scaling Azure App Service instances or AKS pods manually or via auto-scale) and ensure the SK planning components perform efficiently. There is no out-of-the-box auto-scale tailored for your workflow ‚Äì you must configure it.
- **Dependency Management:** SK itself is evolving; updates to the SK library or underlying AI model SDKs require testing and deployment from your side. You‚Äôll need to apply updates to ensure compatibility and benefit from improvements (though SK promises non-breaking changes post v1.0[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/)).
- **Observability:** You should implement logging and monitoring. You can instrument the code to send traces to Azure Monitor or use SK‚Äôs telemetry hooks[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/), but setting this up is part of your development effort. Long-term, you‚Äôll maintain these monitoring solutions (update instrumentation as code changes).
- **Model and Data Management:** If each customer requires a fine-tuned model, your team will run fine-tuning jobs (perhaps via Azure ML or OpenAI) and update the model endpoints the SK solution calls. That pipeline is custom work.

In summary, a custom SK solution behaves like any custom enterprise application: **you incur ongoing maintenance costs** (bug fixes, platform upgrades, security reviews, etc.). Over time, this can be significant, especially as requirements change.

**Dapr Agents (Custom Microservices)** ‚Äì *Highest Maintenance Complexity.* A Dapr/Kubernetes-based approach requires maintaining a **cloud-native deployment**:

- **Kubernetes Cluster Ops:** Regularly upgrade the AKS cluster versions, monitor node health, manage scaling nodes if needed. Apply security patches to the OS level on node pools. Ensure Dapr runtime is updated on the cluster.
- **Microservices Management:** You‚Äôll likely have multiple containerized services (each agent or tool as a service). Managing their lifecycle (CI/CD deployments, container image updates) is non-trivial. Any change in logic means building and deploying new containers.
- **Stateful Workflows:** Dapr Agents provides reliability (retries, state storage)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/), but your team must monitor workflow success/failure, debug issues across distributed components, and maintain the state store (e.g. an Azure Cosmos DB or Redis Dapr component) and message brokers if used.
- **Observability:** Dapr has built-in telemetry and you can forward logs/metrics (it‚Äôs ‚Äúobservable by default‚Äù in design[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/)). Even so, your team needs to maintain the monitoring stack (e.g. a Grafana/Prom stack or Azure Monitor integration) and interpret multi-service traces. Operational complexity is higher due to distributed nature.
- **Scaling & Load Balancing:** Maintaining high throughput (millions of events per day) means carefully tuning concurrent agents and possibly adjusting how pods scale under load. Dapr Agents claims to run ‚Äúthousands of agents on a single core‚Äù by being lightweight[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/), which suggests good efficiency, but your specific use will need testing. You‚Äôll maintain scaling rules at Kubernetes level.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** If each customer is isolated, you might run separate namespaces or even clusters per tenant ‚Äì adding to maintenance overhead.

Overall, while Dapr Agents gives powerful capabilities for resiliency and scale, **the operational burden rests on your team**. It is essentially adopting a microservice product‚Äôs maintenance on top of building the application logic. This is likely the **most resource-intensive in ongoing maintenance**, requiring DevOps expertise permanently.

**Comparative Note:** Foundry‚Äôs managed nature shines in reducing maintenance: **no cluster to manage, no deep troubleshooting of multi-service interactions ‚Äì Microsoft covers those ‚Äúops‚Äù tasks.** SK and Dapr require a dedicated effort to ensure reliability over time. If your team is small or ops is not a core strength, Foundry‚Äôs lower maintenance demands are attractive[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/). If you have a robust DevOps setup and desire full control, you may accept the higher maintenance of custom solutions as the trade-off.

## Scalability to High Loads

**Target Scenario:** The ISV expects to handle **millions of items per day**, where each item might involve document processing or content analysis. Both architecture and cost efficiency come into play for scaling.

**Azure AI Foundry** ‚Äì *Scalability via Managed Infrastructure.* Foundry is built on Azure‚Äôs scalable services. It can **leverage elastic compute and built-in concurrency management**:

- **Serverless Scaling:** Many underlying components in Foundry (like model inference endpoints, Azure Functions used in tools, search indices) are serverless or can auto-scale. For example, if you use Azure OpenAI through Foundry, you can scale the throughput (throughput units or replicas) of the model deployment; Foundry will route calls accordingly.
- **Multi-Agent Workflows:** Foundry‚Äôs agent orchestration can spawn multiple agent instances and runs in parallel. The PaaS should handle ‚Äúburstiness‚Äù ‚Äì e.g., the Build demo noted that Foundry had **10,000+ customers with millions of agents created in preview**„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë, indicating a design for scale.
- **Throughput Guarantees:** While exact limits aren‚Äôt public, Azure likely imposes some quotas (which can be raised). Foundry introduced **Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs)** for model calls ‚Äì meaning you can purchase guaranteed capacity for heavy usage at a discount. This suggests Foundry can **scale up to enterprise volumes** as long as you allocate enough PTUs or use higher tiers.
- **Bottlenecks:** The potential bottleneck in Foundry may be the orchestrator logic if using extremely complex chains. However, Foundry allows integrating **Semantic Kernel‚Äôs Process Framework** to orchestrate deterministically[8](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/SoneparISDOPIACOCKPIT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE3A663B-6A00-4027-83B2-07DFA746137B%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Design.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)[9](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/mpoeckl_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5DB64589-5031-421F-9FCE-2D9FC10FBB22%7D&file=Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20The%20Agent%20Factory.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), which can be optimized for scale (SK itself can run asynchronously and in parallel where needed). Also, Foundry can offload parallel tasks: e.g., fan out to multiple sub-agents (as shown in the triage example where one agent queries FAQ and another queries search simultaneously„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë).

**Verdict:** **Foundry will scale to high loads provided you leverage its scaling features and possibly partition work.** It‚Äôs designed for enterprise scale, and Azure will manage the heavy lifting of distributing load across resources.

**Semantic Kernel (Custom)** ‚Äì *Scalability depends on your architecture.* With SK, scalability is determined by how you deploy it:

- **Single Service Deployment:** If SK is hosted in a single web service, you‚Äôll need to **scale out that service instance** (via AKS pods, VM scale sets, or App Service instances) to handle millions of requests/day. That‚Äôs achievable, but you must ensure stateless design for horizontal scaling. The **process framework** in SK can distribute work if configured (it can run workflows asynchronously and potentially across nodes), but managing that distribution is non-trivial.
- **Parallelism:** SK libraries themselves are relatively lightweight wrappers around model APIs, so the major heavy work is the model inference and any external calls (database, etc.). To scale, you might employ **queue-based load leveling** ‚Äì e.g., queue items and have multiple SK worker instances process them in parallel.
- **Scaling Limits:** There‚Äôs no inherent fixed limit in SK; it‚Äôs custom code running on cloud infrastructure. You can architect it to scale nearly arbitrarily (barring cost): e.g., deploy 50+ instances across regions for global scale. But all the scaling (and failover between instances or regions) is under your team‚Äôs purview to design and test.
- **Caveats:** With very high throughput, **monitor memory and concurrency** ‚Äì SK uses LLM calls which might be slow; if not managed you could pile up requests. A careful design (maybe using asynchronous patterns or batching where possible) will be needed to sustain throughput efficiently. This is an area where proactive performance testing and tuning by your team is required (contrasting with Foundry, where Azure likely has tuned the pipeline).

**Dapr Agents (Custom)** ‚Äì *High Scalability by design, with complexity.* Dapr Agents explicitly **targets enterprise-scale multi-agent systems**:

- It touts running thousands of agents per core and built-in workflow retries[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/), which implies it can scale *vertically* (efficient multi-threading) and *horizontally* (Kubernetes).
- **Kubernetes Scaling:** You can leverage Kubernetes autoscaling to add pods when load increases. Dapr sidecar architecture is optimized for distributed scaling ‚Äì each agent service has its sidecar handling state and messaging.
- **Stateful vs Stateless:** Because Dapr has a Workflow engine, it can keep state context so you can run many workflows concurrently without writing state handling yourself[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). This means even if tasks take time (document processing), you can have many in flight, with Dapr ensuring reliability (it will retry any failed steps, etc., which is crucial at high volume to not lose tasks).
- **Data Loading**: Dapr Agents has ‚Äúdata loading from documents, DBs directly to an agent‚Äù built-in[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). This suggests it can feed large volumes of data efficiently to the AI agents, important for your content-heavy scenario.
- **Limits:** The main limitation is the cluster capacity and the efficiency of your code. If millions per day translate to, say, hundreds per second, you will need enough pods and possibly multiple nodes. Dapr can partition the load, but you must allocate resources. Also, coordination overhead and network latency between microservices can come into play at extreme scale ‚Äì careful profiling is needed to avoid internal bottlenecks (like an overloaded message bus).
- **Results at Scale:** Being cloud-native, a Dapr solution can exploit advanced scaling (multi-region, node auto-scaling). However, the complexity of proving it out is on you. It‚Äôs likely **the most scalable approach if engineered correctly**, but also the one requiring **most performance engineering**.

**Cost Perspective of Scaling:** 
- With **Foundry**, scaling up means increasing usage (and cost) linearly or purchasing throughput capacity. Cost could climb with millions of operations, but you avoid engineering costs of scaling infrastructure.
- With **Custom (SK or Dapr)**, you might handle scaling by paying for compute resources (VMs, AKS nodes). There‚Äôs a possibility of optimizing costs by fine-tuning code and infra (e.g., using cheaper compute for certain tasks, or running open-source models locally to avoid per-call charges). But one must also factor the **developer/DevOps time cost** to implement these optimizations.

**Summary:** All approaches *can* scale to millions of operations per day ‚Äì the difference is **who handles the scaling work**. Foundry‚Äôs cloud service will scale for you (within configured limits) and likely **requires less effort to achieve performance efficiency**, whereas SK and Dapr allow custom scaling strategies at the expense of significant tuning and monitoring by your team. Dapr stands out for robust large-scale patterns (K8s, stateful workflows) if you need maximal throughput and are willing to invest in the infrastructure.

## Customization Effort and Flexibility

**Per-Customer Customization Needs:** The ISV anticipates that each customer will have unique requirements, possibly requiring model fine-tuning or custom workflow variations. The solution must allow tailoring ‚Äúin the details‚Äù quickly and accurately for each tenant.

### Customization Capabilities by Approach

**Azure AI Foundry:**
- **Multi-tenant Projects/Agents:** Foundry lets you create multiple agents or projects, each with its own configuration (prompts, tools, model choices). For each customer, you could spin up a dedicated agent or a set of configurations. This is *largely a configuration task* ‚Äì e.g., adjust the agent‚Äôs instructions or plug in a customer-specific knowledge base. The **effort per customization is relatively low**: update settings via the UI/SDK and redeploy that agent. No need to modify underlying code for each variation, as long as the platform supports the needed variation points.
- **Fine-tuning Models:** Foundry supports fine-tuning or specializing models with customer data[6](https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/sites/smcgcrresources/Shared%20Documents/1.Solution%20Area/Azure/01.Azure%20Solution/Azure%20Data%20&%20AI/%e4%ba%a7%e5%93%81%e6%96%87%e6%a1%a3/OpenAI/FAQ/Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20FAQ.PDF?web=1)[5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE034F074-C965-4EDF-B27D-7F3DE318D726%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI%20-%20MVP%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). This process is integrated: you can fine-tune a model in Foundry‚Äôs model catalog and then assign that fine-tuned model to the agent for that customer. This is easier than building a custom training pipeline from scratch. The time investment is preparing training data, but the platform streamlines running the fine-tune job.
- **Tooling Customization:** If a customer needs a unique data source or action, Foundry has connectors (and the ability to add custom tools via APIs or functions). For example, one customer might need an agent to connect to their proprietary database ‚Äì you can implement an Azure Function or Logic App connector for that and register it as a tool for that customer‚Äôs agent. Foundry **integrates with Azure Functions and OpenAPI easily**[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/), meaning **generating specific code (like an Azure Function) for custom logic is supported** and then plugged in. This aligns with your preference for design-time code: you *can* write custom code for specifics, but you do it in a modular way (as a Function service) rather than altering the overall system.
- **Speed of customization:** Because of the above, adding or tweaking an agent‚Äôs behavior per customer can often be done in hours or days, not weeks. You are often configuring or at most writing small targeted pieces of code (in a familiar Azure Functions way). This means **quick turnaround for new customer requirements**. 

However, **limit on flexibility:** Foundry confines you to the paradigms it supports (LLM-driven agents with tools). If a customer requirement falls outside what the agent can do (e.g., a very specific algorithm or UI), you might hit limits unless the platform allows bringing that code as a tool.

**Semantic Kernel (Custom):**
- **Ultimate Flexibility in Customization:** Since this is essentially your own application, **any part of the workflow can be modified for a customer**. You can use configuration files or strategy patterns to alter logic per tenant. For example, you could have plugins/modules loaded conditionally based on tenant ID. If one customer needs an extra verification step, you can code that branch. If another needs a different sentiment model, you plug that in for them. There are **no inherent limits** except development effort.
- **Effort of Customizing:** The drawback is **each customization could mean writing and maintaining new code**. Even if you use feature flags or configuration, it still requires development to implement those variant behaviors. Over time, supporting many divergent customer-specific branches can bloat the codebase and require careful testing for each update. Fine-tuned model for a customer? You must call the specific model endpoint for that tenant ‚Äì you‚Äôd incorporate that logic. New data source? Write an integration in code.
- **Speed:** Initially, adding new custom logic is straightforward if code structure is good. But as customizations pile up, changes must be regression-tested across all variants. Without focus, this can slow down how quickly you propagate changes. It‚Äôs manageable with good software engineering (modularize per-tenant logic), but inherently slower than flipping a config in a managed tool.

On the positive side, because SK is code-first, **generating specific code at design time is exactly its approach** ‚Äì which matches your philosophy of explicit flows. This can make each implementation very accurate to requirements (no ‚ÄúAI guesswork‚Äù in structure). But to achieve ‚Äúquickly‚Äù, you‚Äôd benefit from a robust internal framework for multi-tenant differences to avoid repetitive work.

**Dapr Agents (Custom Microservices):**
- **Microservice per Customer?** One approach is to deploy separate agent instances or even separate namespaces for each customer‚Äôs flows. Dapr being open-source and ‚Äúin your control‚Äù means you could isolate custom logic either by configuration or by duplicating services. For example, each tenant might have its own configuration for which tools are enabled, or you spin up a custom agent with additional tools for a specific client.
- **Effort:** It‚Äôs similar to SK in that any new requirement likely means coding a new microservice or extending an existing one. The difference is microservices architecture can allow **plugging in new services without affecting others**. E.g., if one customer needs an OCR processing step, you could deploy an OCR service that only their agent calls. The core orchestrator might remain same, just calling an extra tool for that tenant. This compartmentalization can help manage complexity of multi-customers. But it also means potentially **maintaining many small services**.
- **Customization Speed:** Initially slower, because deploying a new service or updating workflows on Kubernetes involves DevOps cycles. But if your pipeline is automated (CI/CD), pushing a new customization can be routine. The question is how complex the custom need is ‚Äì slight config changes are easy (just update a parameter config map for that tenant‚Äôs agent), but new capabilities require development plus deployment. 
- **Flexibility:** Extremely high ‚Äì any workflow the customer wants, you can model it with agents and tools at microservice granularity. Dapr Agents even supports *multi-agent* interactions, so if a customer needs a specialized sub-agent (say a QA checker), you can add that to just their solution. 
- **Maintenance caution:** Over-customization can lead to fragmentation where each deployment is unique. Ideally, you develop a *core generic platform* and only data or model endpoints differ by tenant (like Foundry‚Äôs approach internally). If you instead fork logic per tenant frequently, it may become unwieldy.

### Design-Time Code vs. Dynamic LLM Behavior

You specifically prefer **design-time ‚Äúhard-coded‚Äù flows** rather than letting an LLM decide actions on the fly. This impacts customization approach:

- **Foundry**: By default, an agent might decide how to solve a request (which tool to call, etc.) using the LLM‚Äôs reasoning. However, Foundry supports **deterministic orchestration**. The Build demo combined an LLM agent with a **Semantic Kernel Orchestrator** that deterministically routed tasks (if X, call Y)„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. This means you can design flows graphically or in code and have the LLM only do what you intend at each step. Foundry‚Äôs introduction of **‚Äúmulti-agent workflows powered by Semantic Kernel‚Äù** is exactly to allow precise, coded control of sequences[8](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/SoneparISDOPIACOCKPIT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE3A663B-6A00-4027-83B2-07DFA746137B%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Design.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). So, you can achieve a design-time coded workflow within Foundry‚Äôs environment. This approach requires more upfront setup (writing the workflow logic in SK or Logic Apps), but once done, the agent becomes predictable and easier to customize (change the code flow for that agent).
- **SK**: Everything is essentially design-time code, so it aligns perfectly. There is an option in SK called *Planner* or using AutoGen which would let the AI chain tasks dynamically, but you can avoid that and explicitly script calls. Given your preference, you would implement flows as code, ensuring each step is known. This yields high accuracy and consistency per customer, at the cost of less AI flexibility.
- **Dapr**: Similarly, you would likely program explicit sequences of tool calls or use Dapr Workflows (which are state machines) to deterministically execute steps. Dapr Agents can still use LLM reasoning *within a step* (e.g., the agent reasoning whether to fetch more info), but you can constrain it. The framework was built with reliability in mind (automatic retries and guarantee each task completes in workflows)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/), which implies favoring deterministic patterns that can be retried rather than unpredictable loops. So Dapr is also compatible with design-time flows approach.

**Ease of Customization:** 
- Foundry gets a high score because of **configuration-driven customization**. You can often adjust behavior without redeploying code ‚Äì e.g., update prompt instructions to change tone or criteria, swap out one model for another via portal. This ease means your team can quickly tune the system per client without heavy dev cycles.
- SK and Dapr, being code, are somewhat less ‚Äúpoint-and-click‚Äù and more ‚Äúdevelop and deploy‚Äù. If your team is proficient and has good CI/CD, this can be streamlined, but it‚Äôs inherently a bit slower and requires more QA for each change.

**Bottom Line:** If you anticipate *frequent and granular customizations per client*, Foundry offers a **faster turnaround with less effort per change**, while SK/Dapr offer **unlimited flexibility but require disciplined software engineering** to implement changes swiftly and safely. Many ISVs in such scenarios choose a platform approach to serve many clients efficiently, which is exactly Foundry‚Äôs value proposition (multi-tenant AI solutions). However, if some customers‚Äô needs fall outside what Foundry can accommodate (maybe a very bespoke integration), you might implement those pieces with custom code even alongside Foundry.

### Operational Excellence

**Foundry:** Strong support for operational excellence *by design*. It provides:
- **Unified Monitoring & Logging:** As noted, detailed logs of agent behavior and integrated Application Insights. You have **full thread-level visibility** of each conversation or workflow„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. Foundry‚Äôs portal includes evaluation metrics (intent match, coherence, etc.) and analytic dashboards„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë ‚Äì helping you continuously improve the agents.
- **DevOps Integration:** Foundry offerings include **CI/CD pipelines and project versioning** (Azure AI Foundry projects). There‚Äôs mention of GitHub Codespaces and VS Code integration for Foundry[5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE034F074-C965-4EDF-B27D-7F3DE318D726%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI%20-%20MVP%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). This means you can incorporate Foundry assets (prompts, configs) into source control and release processes ‚Äì supporting disciplined ops.
- **Automation & Templates:** Quickstart templates and an **agent catalog** are provided„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë, capturing best practices. Also, Foundry APIs allow programmatically managing agents, enabling you to script deployments or updates across customers, which is key for an ISV managing many tenant configurations.
- Overall, Foundry makes it easier to **operate at scale with minimal manual intervention**, aligning with operational excellence principles of automation and observability.

**SK:** Being a custom solution, achieving operational excellence is up to your team:
- You‚Äôd need to instrument the application with telemetry, set up dashboards, and define processes for deployment and incident response. The SK library itself has some telemetry hooks[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/), but using them is optional.
- On the plus side, since you're coding, you can integrate whatever monitoring suits you (Azure Monitor, Seq, custom logs). But this is additional work.
- Documenting and automating runbooks (for e.g., how to roll out a new model version or how to recover a stuck workflow) falls on your team.
- It is possible to reach high operational maturity, but it requires designing it in - e.g., include robust error handling and alerting in code. So initially, SK solution might lag in operational tooling until you build it up.

**Dapr:** Dapr was created with production operations in mind (for microservices), which aids operational excellence:
- **Built-in Observability:** Dapr integrates with OpenTelemetry, so logs and traces for each service call can be collected. Dapr Agents specifically says ‚Äúsecure and observable by default‚Äù[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/), meaning it likely emits useful telemetry out-of-box. Still, you need to set up the sinks (like Azure Monitor or Grafana).
- **Operational Complexity:** Running many microservices can complicate operations (multiple logs to aggregate, etc.). But Kubernetes provides mechanisms like centralized logging and service meshes. Dapr simplifies some aspects (consistent sidecar behavior).
- **Automation:** You can use Terraform or scripts to deploy new versions, and Kubernetes can handle health checks and self-healing (restarting failed pods). However, the team must manage these. 
- **Excellence Achieved:** With the right DevOps approach (infrastructure as code, continuous deployment, etc.), you can achieve high operational excellence. It‚Äôs just a **higher bar** to reach because of system complexity.

**Winner:** Foundry likely gives you **operational excellence out-of-the-box** (with minimal configuration, you get good monitoring and ease of management)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). SK and Dapr can achieve it but require deliberate investment. For an ISV, leveraging Foundry could mean less manpower needed for ops in the long run.

### Security

**Foundry:** Very robust in security:
- **Identity and Access Control:** Foundry is integrating **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) for agent identity**. Each agent can have a **Managed Identity (Agent ID)** with assigned permissions to call APIs[10](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Transform-Publishing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B046152C3-C28F-47B7-8D7F-4E30BEF73929%7D&file=Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20Announcements%20at%20Microsoft%20Build%202025_Update_May%2019,%202025.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). For example, an expense-approval agent can be given only the rights to approve expenses in an ERP system and nothing more„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. This built-in support means agents operate under principle of least privilege, traceable in Entra ID logs. (Agent ID was announced as generally available, providing verifiable identities for agents[10](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Transform-Publishing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B046152C3-C28F-47B7-8D7F-4E30BEF73929%7D&file=Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20Announcements%20at%20Microsoft%20Build%202025_Update_May%2019,%202025.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)).
- **RBAC & Data Isolation:** You control which resources (storage, secrets) an agent can access. Foundry allows bring-your-own storage or networks if needed[8](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/SoneparISDOPIACOCKPIT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE3A663B-6A00-4027-83B2-07DFA746137B%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Design.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). Enterprise customers can enforce VNet isolation, meaning data is secure in transit and at rest.
- **Content Safety:** Foundry includes **Azure AI Content Safety** integration[7](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFBED6203-060C-4AA3-B97E-249953823DDE%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). All prompts and responses can be filtered for harmful content by built-in classifiers[11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/content-filtering). It also has **prompt shields** to prevent prompt injection attacks on the agents„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. This addresses a unique AI security concern automatically.
- **Compliance and Governance:** Azure‚Äôs platform helps with compliance (FedRAMP, GDPR etc.). Foundry logs every action an agent takes, so auditing is easier. The mention of **Purview integration** means you can apply data governance policies to AI outputs as well[10](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Transform-Publishing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B046152C3-C28F-47B7-8D7F-4E30BEF73929%7D&file=Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20Announcements%20at%20Microsoft%20Build%202025_Update_May%2019,%202025.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).
- In short, Foundry provides **enterprise-grade security measures by default**, which is a huge advantage. Many of these are non-trivial to build yourself (e.g., content filtering pipeline with multi-language support[11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/content-filtering)).

**Semantic Kernel (Custom):**
- Security is entirely in your hands. You must **authenticate users** to the application and control what the AI can do. Likely you‚Äôll use Azure AD for user auth ‚Äì that part is standard. But for the agent‚Äôs own actions, you might end up using a general service principal or manage secrets, which can be riskier than Foundry‚Äôs per-agent identity. It‚Äôs possible to implement, but you would have to manually create identities for agents and code the auth flows (for example, acquiring tokens for the agent to call an API).
- **Data Protection:** Ensure that any sensitive data (like documents) processed by the AI is properly handled (encrypted at rest, not logged insecurely, etc.). Foundry would handle some of these by configuration, but with SK you must code carefully to avoid leaking info.
- **Threat Protection:** Implement your own filtering for model outputs if needed. Azure OpenAI has some content filters by default, but if using open models, you‚Äôd incorporate checks.
- **Penetration Resistance:** Because you have more free-form coding, the surface for vulnerabilities might be larger (a bug in code could be exploited). You‚Äôd follow secure coding practices and Azure‚Äôs recommendations (like using Managed Identities instead of secrets, enabling network security groups if on AKS).
- Achieving a comparable security level to Foundry‚Äôs will require integrating multiple Azure services (Key Vault for secrets, maybe Azure AD Conditional Access, writing custom content scanning logic or calling Azure Content Safety API).
- Feasible, but the **effort and risk of oversight is higher**.

**Dapr Agents (Custom):**
- Dapr Agents incorporate **security features of Dapr**: built-in mTLS encryption for service calls within the cluster, and centralized secrets management. The CNCF announcement highlights that it builds on Dapr which covers security at scale (used in gov and enterprises)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/).
- **Agent Permissions:** Without Foundry‚Äôs Agent ID, you‚Äôd have to manage service identities. You can still use Azure AD: e.g., each microservice could use a managed identity to access particular resources, or all services share one if appropriate. But likely you‚Äôd design a secure token flow if an agent needs to impersonate a user or have its own credentials.
- **Isolation:** Running on Kubernetes gives you options: isolate customers by namespace, use network policies to restrict egress, etc. These require correct configuration.
- **Content and Prompt Security:** It‚Äôs up to you to implement content safety. Could integrate Azure Content Safety as a service call in the workflow. Dapr Agents doesn't automatically do that (unknown at least).
- **Zero Trust & Auditing:** More work to integrate with corporate security monitoring. The open nature means **no vendor lock-in but also no built-in compliance certification** ‚Äì if you need something like SOC2 compliance, you'll be responsible for proving the security controls in your system.
- So, while Dapr provides building blocks (secure comms, secret store, etc.), **a lot of security design needs to be done by you** to reach Foundry‚Äôs level. It can be done, given Dapr‚Äôs enterprise focus, but again it's more engineering.

**Security Verdict:** **Foundry leads in security** thanks to features like **Entra Agent ID and content filtering baked in[10](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Transform-Publishing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B046152C3-C28F-47B7-8D7F-4E30BEF73929%7D&file=Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20Announcements%20at%20Microsoft%20Build%202025_Update_May%2019,%202025.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)[11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/content-filtering)**. This drastically reduces the risk of misconfiguration or missed vulnerabilities. Custom solutions can be made secure, especially by experienced teams using Azure‚Äôs security services, but Foundry has clear advantages in speed and assurance of security.

### Reliability

**Foundry:**
- **High Availability:** Azure AI Foundry is a managed service running on Azure‚Äôs redundant infrastructure. It likely runs agents across availability zones or has failover, though specific SLA would be given (possibly 99.9% or similar).
- **Failure Handling:** Foundry‚Äôs orchestration manages retries of tool calls. The session at Build emphasized that agents can automatically retry failed actions and log issues[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). If an external API call fails, the agent can catch it and try again or escalate ‚Äì these patterns are built-in to agent design.
- **Scaling for Reliability:** It can auto-scale to handle spikes, preventing downtime from overload (which ties into performance too). 
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Since Foundry is integrated with Azure Monitor, you can set alerts on failures (like if an agent run fails or errors exceed X). This fosters quick detection and remediation.
- **Azure‚Äôs reliability guarantees** (like multi-zone deployments, automatic backups of configuration) apply to Foundry. For example, Foundry likely keeps the agent definitions and conversation logs with redundancy (the Build content hints at backup considerations for thread storage)[8](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/SoneparISDOPIACOCKPIT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE3A663B-6A00-4027-83B2-07DFA746137B%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Design.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).
- In summary, Foundry inherits Azure‚Äôs reliability and adds specialized features to ensure each workflow runs to completion (or gracefully fails with logs). 

**Semantic Kernel:**
- Reliability is a function of your application architecture:
  - If you deploy on a single VM or App Service without redundancy, that‚Äôs a single point of failure. You‚Äôd need to architect for HA (multiple instances, load balancing).
  - You must implement your own **retry logic** for calls (to API, to model). If the LLM doesn‚Äôt respond, will your code try again? Foundry would do it behind scenes, but in SK you have to code it.
  - **State & Recoverability:** If a long-running process partially fails, do you have a mechanism to resume it? Foundry‚Äôs threads and runs concept means state is tracked; on custom side, you might use durable functions or a database to track progress and resume on error.
  - The Process Framework of SK can help here: it‚Äôs built on Azure Durable Functions under the hood when used in cloud, which provides reliability for orchestrations (replay on crash). If you leverage that, your reliability improves (because Durable Functions will persist state and can recover from VM reboots).
- Without using such features, reliability might suffer. But it‚Äôs within your control to mitigate by following cloud design patterns (stateless services, persistent checkpoints, graceful error handling).
- Achieving the same reliability as Foundry means investing in **redundancy, monitoring and self-healing mechanisms**.

**Dapr Agents:**
- Reliability is a core goal: ‚Äúguarantees each agent task completes successfully‚Äù implies use of durable workflow patterns[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). Dapr Workflows (now stable) ensures steps in a workflow are checkpointed; if a node fails mid-process, another instance can pick up from last checkpoint. This inherently boosts reliability of multi-step processes (no lost progress).
- **Resiliency features:** Dapr covers things like automatic retries for failed calls, circuit breakers, etc., that you can configure. Also, by running on Kubernetes, you get features like pod restart on crash, multi-instance deployments, etc.
- **High Availability:** You can run multiple replicas of each service so if one goes down, others handle load. Dapr Agents, when they talk about thousands of agents on a core, suggests that agents are lightweight threads, but if a whole pod or node fails, Kubernetes will reschedule them. Properly set up, the system can be resilient to failures without manual intervention.
- **Complex Failures:** The trade-off is complexity: more moving parts mean more things to potentially go wrong (network splits, etc.), so thorough testing is required. But the framework was built with resiliency in mind (it‚Äôs essentially what Foundry provides within Azure ‚Äì durable orchestrations).
- With careful design, Dapr approach can reach equal or even superior reliability (since you can tailor redundancy at each microservice). But it‚Äôs on you to implement and validate.

**Reliability Winner:** Foundry offers strong reliability without custom effort, whereas SK and Dapr require applying best practices. Dapr‚Äôs workflow and Kubernetes architecture specifically targets reliability issues and likely can match Foundry if configured well[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). If your ISV cannot dedicate extensive infrastructure engineering, Foundry‚Äôs reliability features out-of-box will be a safer bet.

### Performance Efficiency

**Foundry:**
- **Optimized AI Backends:** Foundry gives access to high-performance model endpoints (Azure OpenAI, hosted fine-tuned models) that are optimized on Azure hardware. It also introduced features like a model router/leaderboard for choosing best model for a task[7](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFBED6203-060C-4AA3-B97E-249953823DDE%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), ensuring efficient use of models. 
- **Caching and Search Efficiency:** With *agentic retrieval*, Foundry can decompose queries for better search, which reduces wasted calls and improves speed„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. These sorts of optimizations (using Azure Cognitive Search effectively, etc.) are built-in.
- **Resource Allocation:** Because you can select model size per agent, you avoid using an oversized model for a simple task. Foundry‚Äôs guidance and telemetry help identify if a lighter model can handle a use-case, improving efficiency.
- However, one consideration: running on a managed layer means you might have slight overhead (common for PaaS) ‚Äì e.g., an extra network hop in orchestrating tools. But this overhead is likely minimal compared to overall processing time (which is dominated by LLM inference and I/O).
- In practice, Foundry‚Äôs performance should be **adequate and auto-tuned** for most scenarios. You can scale up the performance by adding capacity (which affects cost, not the architecture).

**SK Custom:**
- You have the opportunity to **optimize every part** of the system if needed. For example, integrate an in-memory cache for recently seen documents to avoid reprocessing, or fine-tune model prompts for minimal tokens (thus faster responses).
- You could self-host certain open-source models for smaller tasks, eliminating latency of calls to a remote API, at the expense of managing those models. (This can improve throughput and reduce cost if done right).
- But achieving great performance requires thorough profiling. A naive implementation might be slower than Foundry because you miss optimizing some step that the Foundry team has.
- SK gives flexibility like multi-threading or using high-performance compute VMs for heavy loads. The developer must ensure the solution efficiently uses CPU/Memory (avoid blocking operations when async would do, etc.).
- There's a risk of inefficiency if the team lacks deep expertise (e.g., might underutilize CPU while waiting on I/O). Foundry likely has balanced those under the hood.
- In sum, **peak performance** might be achievable with a custom build when you fine-tune everything for your scenario, but it will take considerable effort.

**Dapr:**
- Dapr can be highly efficient for throughput: sidecar architecture means certain calls (state store, pubsub) are local network calls to sidecar, which is fast. It‚Äôs built in native code for speed.
- **Concurrency**: Dapr Agents being able to run many agents per core suggests an event-driven, non-blocking runtime ‚Äì very efficient CPU usage[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). This could handle many lightweight tasks concurrently without needing huge thread pools.
- **Scalability vs Efficiency:** On Kubernetes, if something is not efficient, you can just throw more pods at it (scale out). But to keep costs down, you‚Äôll want to optimize code ‚Äì possibly using languages or frameworks that are fast. Python is easy but slower; maybe some performance-critical parts you‚Äôd implement in a faster language or with C extensions.
- **Latency:** Microservices add some latency overhead (calls between services vs in-memory calls in a monolith). But if they are well-contained tasks, these might be negligible milliseconds for heavy tasks. Still, a monolith (SK in one process) could have an edge in latency by avoiding network calls, whereas Dapr breaks tasks into multiple services communicating.
- For processing millions of items, throughput is key and Dapr is designed for high throughput. Efficiency can be high, but only if the architecture is tuned (e.g., avoid a bottleneck service that serializes tasks).
- So performance efficiency is possible but not guaranteed ‚Äì it depends on design and tuning. Dapr offers the tools to be efficient at scale, but you must use them wisely.

**Comparing Efficiency:** 
- If performance (especially latency and resource use) is paramount and your team can micro-optimize, a custom solution may eventually surpass a generic platform.
- Foundry, serving broad use cases, might not be globally the *most* efficient for one specific scenario, but it's likely **sufficiently optimized for typical enterprise loads**, and you gain efficiency through rapid scaling and not re-inventing baseline features.
- For majority of cases, Foundry‚Äôs efficiency is excellent without special effort (especially when using Azure‚Äôs latest model infrastructure). Unless you need real-time low-latency responses at extreme scale or want to trim every millisecond, Foundry's performance is fine.
- It‚Äôs worth noting Foundry also supports on-device deployment (Foundry Local) for edge scenarios[7](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFBED6203-060C-4AA3-B97E-249953823DDE%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). That means for some cases, you could even push models to edge devices via Foundry, which is an advanced performance scenario (less relevant to multi-customer cloud, but noteworthy).

### Cost Optimization

This pillar is about managing costs, not just being cheap but getting good value.

**Foundry Costs:**
- Foundry likely charges for **compute and usage**. This includes:
  - Charges for model inference (similar to Azure OpenAI pricing for tokens).
  - Possibly charges for agent runtime (maybe per 1,000 requests orchestrated, etc.).
  - Data storage costs for logs, etc., if large.
- The **advantage** is you only pay for what you use (there‚Äôs no idle server cost). It can scale down to zero if no usage. Also, you can explicitly control cost via provisioning (for example, commit to a certain throughput for a discount or scale certain services off during low usage times).
- **No infra maintenance cost**: you don‚Äôt pay engineers to manage VMs or clusters (that saving is real).
- **Cost Transparency:** Foundry‚Äôs pricing might be complex (multiple components), but Azure provides a calculator and cost management tools. You can set budgets and alerts for usage.
- If millions of operations are heavy on LLM calls, costs can rise quickly on any platform. Foundry‚Äôs strength is letting you optimize usage (like using cheaper models where possible, which you can configure when customizing an agent‚Äôs model).
- Also, multi-tenant usage might allow some economies of scale: if you fine-tune one model that benefits multiple customers, you do it once in Foundry and reuse it.
- **Downside:** It might be more expensive at scale compared to self-hosting open source (because Azure charges margins for convenience). If you can significantly reduce cost by custom infra (like running an open model on a GPU server at fixed cost), Foundry‚Äôs consumption model might look pricier for constant heavy load. But one has to consider the total cost including devops and reliability.

**SK & Dapr Costs:**
- **Infrastructure**: Running on AKS or App Services incurs its own costs. E.g., an AKS cluster with enough nodes to handle peak can be costly (though you can auto-scale down when idle).
- **Resource Utilization**: A well-optimized custom solution could use resources more efficiently for certain tasks. For example, if using a small model for sentiment, you could run it on CPU in your container, avoiding the cost of calling an external API (but then you invest in hosting that model).
- **Third-party Services**: You might still call Azure AI services (like Form Recognizer for document intelligence) and pay for those. So not all costs are avoided.
- **DevOps/Dev time**: It‚Äôs not directly a cloud bill item, but the engineering hours to develop and maintain are a cost. WAF cost optimization considers operational costs too. Foundry reduces that operational cost, while custom solutions increase it. This should be factored ‚Äì ISVs often value quicker time-to-market and lower maintenance burden as cost savings.
- **Opportunity Cost**: If your team spends 6 months building a platform that Foundry could provide in 1 month, that‚Äôs 5 months of lost features or market.
  
**Optimizing Custom Solution Costs:**
- You can choose where to run: maybe on reserved instances or spot VMs for cheaper compute.
- You have the freedom to use open-source: e.g., using an open-source LLM could avoid per-call costs, but you'll incur VM/GPU costs.
- If usage is extremely high and steady, owning hardware (or reserved capacity) might be cheaper than per-call billing. The user did mention ‚Äúowning the compute on AKS is an aspiration but not a must‚Äù ‚Äì meaning they consider running on their own managed cluster if it proves more cost-effective in long run.
- But running your own at high scale also means you must size for peak ‚Äì possibly paying for capacity that sits idle at times. Foundry‚Äôs elasticity could be more cost-efficient if load fluctuates.

**Which Saves Money?** This depends on usage patterns:
- For **low to medium scale or rapidly growing scenarios**, Foundry‚Äôs pay-per-use is cost-optimized (no upfront big expenses).
- For **massive constant scale**, a well-tuned custom platform might achieve lower per-request costs (especially if it can rely on cheaper models or bulk compute deals).
- However, given an ISV with multiple customers, likely usage varies and having the flexibility to scale per tenant is valuable ‚Äì Foundry can isolate costs per project/customer.

**Cost Governance:** Foundry integrates with Azure Cost Management, allowing you to track costs per project easily and even attribute costs to customers if needed for billing. In a custom solution, you‚Äôd have to measure and attribute usage per client yourself to know profit margins.

In summary, **cost optimization** with Foundry revolves around using the right configuration and scaling options provided (and leveraging Azure discounts), whereas cost optimization with custom solutions requires you to carefully choose tech stack and cloud resources and continuously refine for cost-performance balance. Foundry simplifies this aspect by externalizing many costs directly (you pay as you go), turning many capital expenses into operational ones.

## Document Intelligence & Content Understanding Features

Handling documents and rich content is a key requirement. Let‚Äôs see how each approach supports **Document Intelligence** (extracting info from docs) and **Content Understanding** (analyzing text, images for sentiment, etc.):

**Azure AI Foundry:**
- Foundry is expanding with dedicated **Azure AI Document Intelligence** capabilities[7](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFBED6203-060C-4AA3-B97E-249953823DDE%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). This likely refers to integration with Azure Form Recognizer or similar services under a unified interface. Indeed, ‚ÄúMultimodal processing for agents with Azure AI Content Understanding‚Äù was a Build session[5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE034F074-C965-4EDF-B27D-7F3DE318D726%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI%20-%20MVP%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), indicating new services to analyze PDFs, images, etc. As a result, Foundry agents can directly use these capabilities as **tools**. For example, an agent can call a *Document Processing* tool that extracts structured data from an invoice or a contract using pre-trained models.
- **Content Understanding** includes things like sentiment analysis, classification, summarization, etc. Foundry can use Azure Cognitive Services (Language services) behind the scenes. Given it's a Microsoft platform, it likely has or will have connectors to Text Analytics, Vision API, etc., or incorporate them natively. The Build readiness info mentions "New Azure AI services for Content Understanding and Voice"[5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE034F074-C965-4EDF-B27D-7F3DE318D726%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI%20-%20MVP%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), suggesting you can do OCR, image captioning, speech-to-text, etc., as part of agent workflows.
- This means **little custom work** to get document AI: you select the appropriate tool and provide the document, and the agent gets the result. The compute and model for that are managed by Azure. The output can then be fed into the reasoning chain (for example, agent reads a scanned PDF by first using Document Intelligence tool).
- Also, Foundry‚Äôs search integration (Azure Cognitive Search) can ingest documents and allow the agent to retrieve relevant text. This addresses content understanding from an info-retrieval perspective (common Q&A over documents scenario).
- **Accuracy and improvement**: Since these services are pre-built by Microsoft, they are high-quality and continuously improved. You don't need to train your own OCR or sentiment model (unless you choose to, in which case Foundry likely allows using custom or fine-tuned models too).
- So, Foundry offers **comprehensive, ready-to-use document and content AI** functionalities, accelerating any workflow that needs to parse or comprehend files.

**Semantic Kernel Custom:**
- SK doesn‚Äôt provide AI models itself; you integrate whatever you need. For document intelligence, you have a few options:
  - Use Azure Form Recognizer via its SDK/REST in your code to do things like extract text or tables from documents. You‚Äôll have to call these APIs and handle the results as part of your workflow. It‚Äôs doable, but it‚Äôs an extra integration step you must code and maintain (including auth keys, etc.).
  - Use open-source libraries if you want (like Tesseract for OCR, or a Python NLP library for sentiment). But then you handle scaling those and ensure their accuracy is acceptable.
  - **Semantic Kernel‚Äôs advantage** is that it can orchestrate these calls if you wrap them as ‚Äúskills.‚Äù For instance, you might create a ‚ÄúDocumentSkill‚Äù that uses Form Recognizer to get text, then pipelines into a prompt that summarizes it. SK can help chain these but you implement the glue.
  - For sentiment or classification, you could just call Azure Cognitive Service for sentiment (one API call, fairly easy). Or even ask the LLM: *‚ÄúRate the sentiment of this text‚Äù*. But relying on an LLM for that might be less consistent than a purpose-built model. You can decide approach per use-case.
- Overall, **all functionalities are available to you, but not out-of-the-box**. You need to integrate them one by one. This increases development and testing effort for those features (ensuring each content type yields correct results).
- The positive side: you can choose **best-of-breed or custom models** for each need. If you want a specific sentiment analysis tuned to financial text, you could plug that in instead of a general model.
- But if timeline and effort are concerns, reusing Azure‚Äôs services via Foundry is simpler.

**Dapr Agents Custom:**
- Very similar to SK in that **you must integrate content AI services**:
  - Perhaps one microservice is dedicated to document processing. It could call Azure Form Recognizer and return the structured output to the rest of the workflow. With Dapr, you can encapsulate this nicely as a tool usable by agents (the CNCF blog‚Äôs example: an agent calls a `get_pr_code` tool that fetches code from GitHub[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/) ‚Äì analogous to an agent calling `extract_invoice_data` tool you implement).
  - Dapr makes it easy to structure these as separate components, which is clean. But you still have to implement the logic within that component (i.e., call the cognitive service and handle errors).
  - If some customers might have on-prem documents, the microservice could also contain custom logic to connect to their storage, etc.‚Äîall possible with Dapr's flexibility.
- There's no built-in library of AI in Dapr Agents. It's more of an orchestration framework. Dapr does have some building blocks like **Workflow** (which is logic, not model) and they've introduced an LLM conversation API to simplify using LLMs in agents, but not specific to doc analysis. So you'd rely on external services for the AI heavy lifting, similarly to SK.
- Essentially, you create a microservice for each "skill": a sentiment service (calls cognitive service or uses an on-disk model), an OCR service, etc. That microservice can be reused across agents and tenants, which is good design. Dapr would help route requests to it reliably.
- However, developing and maintaining each such service is additional work. If Microsoft or community eventually provides reusable Dapr components for common AI tasks, that could help, but currently these would be custom.

**Conclusion on Document/Content AI:** Foundry significantly lowers the effort to implement document understanding and sentiment analysis capabilities by providing **pre-integrated cognitive services as agent tools**[7](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFBED6203-060C-4AA3-B97E-249953823DDE%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)[5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE034F074-C965-4EDF-B27D-7F3DE318D726%7D&file=Build%2025_Topic%20Readiness%20AI%20-%20MVP%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). Custom approaches require integrating those services manually but offer more tailoring if needed. Given an ISV context, using robust, generalized document AI services from Azure via Foundry is likely sufficient (and faster) versus trying to outdo those or manage their integration yourself.

## Design-Time Code vs. Dynamic LLM Orchestration

One of your core concerns is whether to rely on LLMs to dynamically decide workflow steps (which can be unpredictable) or to use static, coded logic decided at design time. Let‚Äôs weigh the pros and cons and how each approach supports these modes:

**Dynamic LLM-based Orchestration:** This refers to letting the AI agent figure out which actions to take, e.g., chain-of-thought planning, like ‚ÄúAgent, if question needs data, call tool X; if not, answer directly.‚Äù Frameworks like LangChain or even Foundry‚Äôs agent by default operate this way ‚Äì the agent chooses tools based on its prompt and some reasoning.

- *Pros:* Very flexible, can handle scenarios you didn‚Äôt explicitly code by general reasoning. Less upfront coding of flows.
- *Cons:* Can be inconsistent or make errors (like choosing wrong tool), harder to **ensure correctness or compliance** (since the AI might skip a step or use a tool in unintended way). Also potentially slower because the agent might take multiple reasoning turns to decide next steps.

**Design-Time Specific Code:** This means you, the developer, enumerate the flow: e.g., *First do A, then if result meets condition B, do C, else do D.* It‚Äôs like a traditional algorithm, possibly calling AI for sub-tasks but not letting AI control the flow.

- *Pros:* Predictable and testable. Each path can be verified, and edge cases can be handled explicitly. It aligns with compliance needs (you know exactly what happens, e.g., a loan application will *always* check credit score with no chance of skipping).
- *Cons:* Less adaptive ‚Äì if a new situation arises that wasn‚Äôt coded, the system might not handle it as gracefully as an AI might. Also requires more development for each new type of problem.

**Foundry's Support:** Foundry allows both:
- Out-of-the-box, an agent could be one big reasoning loop (LLM picking tools). But Foundry introduced **Workflow Definition through SK** to get determinism[8](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/SoneparISDOPIACOCKPIT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE3A663B-6A00-4027-83B2-07DFA746137B%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Design.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1). The Build demo orchestrated multiple specialized agents with a fixed logic (triage, then either FAQ agent or RAG agent, then orchestrator deciding to email or escalate) using code„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. In that demo, they explicitly coded the routing logic in C# (with SK‚Äôs Process Framework) ‚Äì meaning the critical decisions were design-time, not left to a single AI to figure out.
- So Foundry supports a **hybrid**: use static flows at high level, and within each step, use AI for what it‚Äôs good at (unstructured tasks). This seems the ideal mix: *deterministic structure, AI for content.* For example, ‚Äúextract data from document‚Äù is done by a fixed sequence (call OCR then parse fields) and only the parsing part is AI.
- Foundry‚Äôs **Connected Agents** feature even allows linking one agent to use another‚Äôs abilities, which can be carefully orchestrated rather than emergent[8](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/SoneparISDOPIACOCKPIT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE3A663B-6A00-4027-83B2-07DFA746137B%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Design.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).
- If you prefer code, you can lean heavily on that in Foundry (treating it more as an orchestration engine with AI plugins). If you prefer dynamic, you can give the agent more autonomy. Foundry gives the choice per scenario.

**Semantic Kernel:** It‚Äôs up to you entirely. SK can do dynamic planning using a component like `Planner` or Microsoft‚Äôs AutoGen library[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/)[4](https://techoral.com/ai/ai-agent-frameworks.html). But you can ignore that and just call functions in a fixed order.
- Since your preference is for generating code, you‚Äôd likely use SK to **implement a fixed sequence** of steps (maybe with some conditional branches coded in C#). SK doesn‚Äôt force you to do chain-of-thought unless you use those specific features.
- The developer in you can ensure robust error checking at each step and make the flow as transparent as any non-AI program. The AI is just doing micro-tasks like ‚Äúclassify text‚Äù or ‚Äúgenerate summary,‚Äù under strict supervision of the code.
- This yields high reliability and usually simpler debugging (because you can log each step‚Äôs result and you know which step should come next by code).
- The drawback is if you want to add a new pattern of reasoning, you must code it. But given your comfort with code, that might be fine.

**Dapr Agents:** Similar to SK, but in a distributed sense. You likely design explicit workflows (maybe using Dapr Workflows DSL). For instance, a Dapr workflow could say:
```
If sentiment < 0.5 then
    call EscalateAgent
else
    call AutoReplyAgent
```
This is defined at design-time. The actual sentiment value might be computed by an LLM or a service, but the branch threshold is your rule.
- Dapr‚Äôs support for dynamic decisions could come from including an AI agent that itself decides something. But you would incorporate that intentionally.
- Given Dapr's philosophy, **predictable orchestration** seems to be encouraged (the emphasis on stateful workflows and success guarantees suggests structured flows over ad-hoc ones).
- Dapr can also do event-driven asynchronous flows, which is deterministic in pattern albeit dynamic in timing.
- You can always embed an autonomous AI agent that does its own thing, but since your goal is correctness, you'd likely give AI minimal autonomy under Dapr ‚Äì just like with SK (the agent might decide what the answer content is, but not whether to trigger some compliance check ‚Äì that you'd enforce with code or separate agent).

In conclusion, **design-time coded flows** increase confidence and make it easier to meet strict requirements (which many enterprise customers will have). All approaches allow this:
- Foundry: yes, through SK or Logic Apps integration[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/).
- SK: inherently yes, you're coding everything.
- Dapr: yes, via defined workflows and microservice interactions.

The key difference is that a platform like Foundry with integrated SK gives you **the best of both**: you can quickly assemble flows from existing components *and* enforce deterministic logic, whereas SK/Dapr you build from scratch but have full control. As an ISV selling to multiple clients, having a platform that allows easy adjustments (maybe one client is okay with dynamic agent for some internal support, another regulated client needs strictly controlled steps) is valuable. Foundry would let you configure each accordingly ‚Äì e.g., use a free-form agent for one use-case, a locked-down workflow for another ‚Äì all within one system. With SK, you'd have to implement both styles yourself if needed.

## Best Practices for Integration into Existing Workflows

Finally, consider how to integrate these solutions with the ISV‚Äôs and the customers‚Äô existing systems and workflows. The chosen solution should play nicely with databases, CRMs, or other enterprise apps already in use.

**Foundry Integration Best Practices:**
- **Use Connectors and APIs:** Foundry makes integration easier by providing connectors to common services (DBs via Azure Functions, web APIs via OpenAPI, etc.). Best practice is to use these rather than building custom logic where possible. For instance, connect to the customer‚Äôs database through an API and call it from the agent.
- **Encapsulate Business Logic in Tools:** Keep each integration as a separate ‚Äútool‚Äù that the agent uses. This modularizes the integration. E.g., one tool for ‚ÄúGetCustomerData‚Äù calls a REST API to CRM. Within Foundry, define that tool with OpenAPI or a Logic App connector. **Test each tool independently** to ensure it returns correct data for given inputs.
- **Leverage Foundry‚Äôs Identity Integration:** When integrating with enterprise systems, use the agent‚Äôs Entra ID capability to access them. That means registering the agent (or the tool‚Äôs logic app function) as an app in the customer‚Äôs AD and granting least privilege. This yields smooth SSO experiences and audit trails (e.g. an action is logged as performed by ‚ÄúAgent X‚Äù identity).
- **Workflow Orchestration:** For complex integrations (like multi-step approvals), use Foundry‚Äôs multi-agent workflows and possibly incorporate human approval steps. Foundry allows sending out notifications or working with Teams/Outlook (like the demo escalated to a human via Teams message„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë). This is a great pattern: if an agent hits something it can‚Äôt handle, integrate with the human workflow (perhaps by creating a task in a system or sending an email).
- **Monitor & Optimize Integration Performance:** Use Foundry‚Äôs metrics to see if any integration calls are slow or failing often„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë. If so, consider caching frequently needed data or adjusting how often the agent calls that system. Foundry being in Azure means you can also co-locate resources (deploy the agent and the integrated function in same region for low latency).
- **Version Control Configurations:** Treat the agent definitions and tool configurations similarly to code. Use the Foundry project CLI/SDK to export these to JSON or scripts, store in a repo. This way, any integration changes go through code review and change management. Foundry likely supports DevOps pipelines for this (maybe using Bicep/ARM or CLI commands).
- **Gradual Rollout:** When introducing the agent into a customer's environment, do a pilot/test mode. E.g., initially run the agent in observation mode (not actually executing actions, just suggesting) to gain trust, then gradually allow it to perform automated actions once confidence is high. Foundry‚Äôs content filters and evaluations help ensure it‚Äôs making safe decisions during this testing phase„ÄêBRK149‚Ä†„Äë.

**Semantic Kernel Integration Best Practices:**
- **Design a Clear API Layer:** If integrating with external systems, abstract those calls in separate classes or services in your code. This is analogous to tools in Foundry. It keeps the AI planning or prompting logic separate from direct integration code. For example, have a function like `GetCustomerInfo(customerId)` which internally calls the DB or API. The rest of your SK code just calls that function. This makes it easier to update the integration or swap it out (or mock it in tests).
- **Use Azure Services for Integration:** Instead of custom code for everything, use Azure Logic Apps or Power Automate for some integrations and call them from your code. This can reduce complexity. For instance, if a workflow needs to put data in SharePoint and send an email, one can automate that outside of SK and just trigger it.
- **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Integrations often fail due to timeouts, network issues, etc. Wrap calls with retries and fallback logic. Use SK‚Äôs context or a global exception handler to catch failures and respond gracefully (maybe respond to user: ‚ÄúSystem is busy, try again‚Äù).
- **Security and Secrets:** Store connection strings/API keys in Azure Key Vault and load them at runtime (or use Managed Identities to access resources directly). Avoid putting any sensitive info in prompts or logs. Sanitize what the AI sees (e.g., mask PII if sending logs to AI for analysis).
- **Logging and Audit:** Build logs for all integration calls ‚Äì what was called, when, by which user agent, etc. This is crucial for debugging integration issues and providing audit trails to customers. If using SK, you can intercept and log at the integration function level.
- **Documentation:** Document the integration points clearly for each customer environment ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúAI agent will call endpoint X with data Y, ensure firewall allows it, and output will be stored here.‚Äù With custom solutions, this clarity helps onboarding new customers.
- **Harness Webhooks/Events:** Many enterprise systems offer webhook/event integration. Instead of polling from the AI side, consider pushing events to your AI workflow. SK could be set up to handle an incoming event triggers (maybe via a minimal API endpoint that feeds it into the process). This can be efficient: e.g., when a new support ticket is created in system, trigger the AI summarization process, rather than AI periodically asking for new tickets.

**Dapr Integration Best Practices:**
- **Use Dapr Components:** Dapr has a library of components for binding to external systems (e.g., pub/sub to various queues, output bindings to send emails, etc.). Use these where possible rather than writing raw integration code, as they are tested and can be declaratively configured. For example, if you need to write to a database, use a Dapr state component for that DB if available.
- **Separate Microservices for Integration:** Isolate the interaction with each external system in its own microservice if it simplifies things. This way, you encapsulate all complexity of that integration in one place. Agents then just invoke that service (which might simply expose an endpoint for "do X in system Y").
- **Asynchronous Patterns:** For long-running or less critical integrations, use Dapr pub/sub. E.g., agent generates a report and then publishes an event ‚ÄúReportReady‚Äù which another service picks up and sends via email. This decoupling improves resilience and keeps agent logic lean.
- **State Management:** For content like documents, consider storing them in a blob storage and pass references around, instead of large payloads. Dapr can manage a blob store component; agents just share a blob key. This avoids hitting size limits or memory issues.
- **Batching:** If millions of items need processing, sometimes batching requests to external systems can improve throughput. Dapr workflows or a custom service could accumulate several AI outputs and then send in one go if the target system supports it. But ensure batching doesn‚Äôt add unacceptable latency.
- **Testing in Isolation:** Microservices allow you to test integration stub by stub. Use dummy endpoints to simulate the customer environment in a staging cluster. Dapr even has a test SDK to simulate calls without a full cluster. Ensure each integration service properly handles edge cases (like API downtime).
- **Keep Configurations Separate:** Use Dapr configuration or environment variables to store endpoint URLs, not hard-coded. For each customer deployment, you can adjust these via config maps. This avoids rebuilding images for different environments ‚Äì you simply redeploy with a different config for that tenant‚Äôs endpoints.
- **Networking:** If integrating to on-prem systems, likely you‚Äôll use VPN or ExpressRoute. On AKS, that means running inside a VNet. Ensure Dapr sidecars and your services are configured to use the VNet and have correct DNS to reach on-prem endpoints. That might involve Azure Hybrid Connectivity (like VNet Integration or using API Management as a bridge). Foundry might have easier solutions for hybrid connectivity (maybe via connectors).

**General Best Practices Regardless of Choice:**
- **Phase-wise integration:** Start with read-only or advisory mode, then move to transactional actions once stable.
- **User Training & Acceptance:** Ensure the end-users or admins understand what the AI is doing in their context. Provide logs or explanations (like ‚ÄúThe AI set field X because it detected Y in the document‚Äù) to build trust.
- **Fail-safe:** Always have a manual override. If AI fails or gives low confidence, route the task to a human or fallback process. All approaches can incorporate this: Foundry with human-in-loop features, SK with conditional logic, Dapr with fallbacks to a manual queue.
- **Feedback Loop:** Gather user feedback on AI outputs (maybe a simple ‚ÄúWas this answer helpful?‚Äù prompt) and use it to improve. Foundry has evaluations which can incorporate ranking feedback; custom ones can store feedback and periodically retrain or adjust rules.

Integrating an AI solution into real business workflows is as much a people/process challenge as a technical one. A measured, transparent approach tends to work best, and whichever platform you choose, ensure it supports that approach through logs, identity, and control points.

# Conclusion and Recommendations

**Azure AI Foundry** offers a **faster development path, lower maintenance, and enterprise-ready features** (security, scaling, compliance) that align with the ISV‚Äôs needs to customize solutions per customer quickly. Its integrated tools for document processing and content analysis mean you can build rich workflows with minimal custom code, focusing on delivering business logic rather than reinventing AI infrastructure. Foundry particularly excels in **security (with Entra ID integration)[10](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Transform-Publishing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B046152C3-C28F-47B7-8D7F-4E30BEF73929%7D&file=Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20Announcements%20at%20Microsoft%20Build%202025_Update_May%2019,%202025.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) and operational monitoring**, reducing risk when deploying AI for multiple clients.

**Semantic Kernel** and **Dapr Agents**, on the other hand, provide **maximum flexibility and control**. They can eventually be tuned to specific performance or cost optimizations (like using custom models or specialized infrastructure) and allow you to architect bespoke workflows beyond the confines of a managed platform. However, this comes at the cost of **higher initial development effort and ongoing DevOps burden**. To meet the same level of reliability, security, and compliance as Foundry, a custom solution would require substantial engineering investment and cloud expertise.

Given that **customization per customer is a priority**, Foundry‚Äôs model of configuration-driven customization (with the ability to plug in custom code where necessary) seems well-suited. It lets your team implement unique requirements as modular tools or fine-tuned models without breaking the overall framework ‚Äì thereby achieving both **accuracy and speed** in tailoring solutions. Additionally, by favoring **design-time workflow coding within Foundry‚Äôs environment**, you can maintain the determinism you want while still leveraging AI for the unstructured parts of the tasks.

**Recommendation:** For an ISV handling many clients with overlapping yet distinct requirements, Azure AI Foundry appears to provide the best balance. It significantly reduces time-to-market and ensures that critical non-functional requirements (scalability, security, compliance) are met by default[1](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Azure-AI-Foundry-Agent-Service-vs-Semantic-Kernel/)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). Your team can focus on building domain-specific value (the ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù for each customer scenario) rather than building and managing an AI platform from scratch. Furthermore, Foundry‚Äôs continuous improvements (as seen with new features coming out at Build 2025) mean your solution will automatically stay current with AI advancements, which is crucial in the fast-moving AI landscape.

That said, **if owning compute and minimizing usage costs becomes paramount in the future (e.g., you reach a scale where platform fees overtake the cost of self-hosting)**, you could consider a hybrid approach: use Foundry for rapid development and early deployments, and gradually migrate certain high-volume components to a custom infrastructure (perhaps using Semantic Kernel or Dapr) once they are well-understood and stable. This way, you get the benefits of both in stages ‚Äì quick wins now, and potential cost savings later for specific pieces.

In conclusion, leveraging Azure AI Foundry now will likely accelerate your ability to deliver a multi-tenant, AI-powered solution that adheres to the **5 Well-Architected Framework pillars** and meets your customers‚Äô needs for customization and reliability[8](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/SoneparISDOPIACOCKPIT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE3A663B-6A00-4027-83B2-07DFA746137B%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Design.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)[2](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/12/announcing-dapr-ai-agents/). As the solution matures, you can continuously evaluate cost and performance metrics and adjust the underlying implementation (perhaps introducing more custom elements or optimizing usage plans) to ensure long-term sustainability and client satisfaction.
