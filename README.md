# AI Samples : Ideas & More

This repository provides a collection of generic AI-related examples to help customers explore and implement common use cases with ease. The samples span various programming languages and demonstrate practical applications of AI technologies in diverse scenarios.

## Current Samples

### 1. Ingredient Check (Python)

The notebook [`recipe_check/ingredient_check.ipynb`](recipe_check/ingredient_check.ipynb) demonstrates how to determine the feasibility of preparing specific dishes based on a list of available ingredients. This example utilizes Azure OpenAI to process structured inputs and generate actionable outputs.

#### Key Features:
- **Input**: A list of dishes and a list of available ingredients.
- **Output**: 
  - A boolean indicating if the dish can be prepared.
  - A list of required ingredients for each dish, including any that are missing.
- **Implementation**: Showcases Azure OpenAI's structured output capabilities using Python and the `pydantic` library for input/output validation.

> **Important**: While the AI provides insights into recipe feasibility, the actual results also depend on your culinary skills. AI can't cook your spaghetti! ðŸ˜„
